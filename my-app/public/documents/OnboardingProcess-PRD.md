**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: 2023-09-18  
**Status**: Draft

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The Distributed Data Security Platform (DDSP) is a next-generation solution for enterprises requiring advanced data security and robust access control. This platform leverages distributed ledger technology (IPFS) and zero-trust data formats (OpenTDF) to create a comprehensive data security ecosystem that protects sensitive information while maintaining accessibility for authorized users.

### 1.1 Vision Statement

To enable enterprises to maintain complete control of their data throughout its lifecycle by implementing decentralized storage with granular access controls, ensuring data integrity, and providing immutable audit trails.

### 1.2 Goals and Objectives

- Create a scalable platform for secure data storage and sharing
- Implement zero-trust architecture for data access
- Provide granular access control mechanisms
- Establish immutable audit logs of all data access and modifications
- Enable seamless integration with existing enterprise systems
- Build a user-friendly management interface for non-technical stakeholders

## 2. Target Audience

### 2.1 Primary Users

- **Enterprise Security Officers**
  - Technical decision-makers responsible for data security protocols
  - Require comprehensive visibility of data access and security posture

- **Compliance Managers**
  - Responsible for ensuring adherence to regulatory requirements
  - Need audit-ready reports and verification of security controls

- **Data Administrators**
  - Manage access permissions and data organization
  - Configure security policies and protocols

### 2.2 Secondary Users

- **End Users**
  - Employees accessing secure data through authenticated channels
  - Varying technical expertise levels

- **System Integrators**
  - Technical staff connecting the platform to existing systems
  - Need comprehensive APIs and documentation

## 3. Market Opportunity

### 3.1 Market Need

Enterprises face increasingly complex data security challenges, including:
- Growing frequency and sophistication of data breaches
- Expanding regulatory requirements for data protection
- Increased risk from distributed/remote workforce
- Need for granular control over who can access what data and when

### 3.2 Competitive Landscape

Traditional security solutions focus on perimeter security or cloud-based access controls, while our solution implements:
- Decentralized storage reducing single points of failure
- Zero-trust approach where data itself is protected, not just access points
- Immutable ledger records ensuring auditability and compliance
- File-level encryption and granular access controls
